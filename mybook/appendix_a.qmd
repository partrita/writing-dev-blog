# appendix A Publishing and writing resources

This appendix discusses options for publishing your blog posts, as well as tools to help you create and optimize them. All tools that we mention offer a free tier (at the time of writing, at least) unless otherwise noted.

# A.1 Where to post your posts?

If you’re not contributing to a company blog, where do you publish your blog posts? Here’s a quick look at popular options: your own blog, Medium and friends, Substack, and publications with a lightweight editorial review/approval process (e.g., HackerNoon and DZone).

# A.1.1 Build your own blog site

If you plan to write a number of articles beyond your company blog, strongly consider standing up your own site. In addition to hosting your blog, this site can include your bio, links to projects, talks, and articles—whatever else you’d like to showcase. This option gives you complete control over every element: from plugins, to look and feel, to what’s shown alongside each of your articles. Build it however you like, with whatever frameworks you want an excuse to play with. Static site generators are popular options for blogging.

Jekyll (https://jekyllrb.com/) on GitHub Pages (https://pages.github.com/) is a popular combo for minimalist sites. Since GitHub Pages is powered by Jekyll, you can deploy a Jekyll site using GitHub for free, with a custom domain name.

Other static site generator options include Hugo (https://gohugo.io/) and Gatsby (https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). Content Management System (CMS) options include Ghost (https://ghost.org/) and, of course, the stalwart WordPress (https://wordpress .com/)— neither of which currently offer a free tier beyond the initial trial. WordPress does offer a self-hosted open source version, though: just go to the .org site (https:// wordpress.org/) instead of the enterprise (.com) one. Hacker News and Reddit both feature highly opinionated discussions on how the options compare and which is best for different needs.

TIP If you want a clean minimalist blog like the first example featured in chapter 3, you can simply copy its code. The author, Alex Morales, shared it at https://github.com/alexmolas/alexmolas.github.io

If you want a chance at additional exposure, you can also post copies of your articles on aggregators such as Medium and friends (see chapter 15).

# A.1.2 Medium and friends

If you really don’t want to manage your own blog site, you can publish primarily on a blog aggregator platform (e.g., Medium, dev.to, or Hashnode). You won’t have total control over every aspect of the reader’s experience. But it’s fast, it’s simple, and there’s a chance that one of your articles might go viral via that platform’s recommendation algorithms. For example, if Medium curators boost one of your posts, you could get an instant spike in attention that rivals what you could achieve by trending on Hacker News. Similarly, publishing on dev.to makes your articles easily accessible to a community of over one million developers.

Whichever platform you select, you will get a URL with your profile and centralized access to all the articles you’ve published there. Custom domains are supported on Medium. And readers who really enjoy your work can follow you via in-platform alerts

and email notifications (for Medium at least). With Medium, you have full access to the email addresses that the platform collects; you can export the information, port them to a new platform, and so forth.

Medium currently offers monetization options through a Partner Program. Readers do not pay you directly. Earnings are determined and managed by Medium, based on how long Medium members spend reading your articles, as well as member engagement points.

# A.1.3 Substack

Substack is another popular alternative to maintaining your own blog site. It’s a newsletter-focused platform that’s especially well-suited to authors who already have a devoted following—or expect they can build one.

In addition to providing a cleanly templated article hub, Substack distributes your posts to people who opted in to an email newsletter subscription. As with Medium, you own the email addresses that are collected. But Substack also provides native email functionality that lets you message your subscribers en masse or send customized messages based on specific criteria (e.g., one message to people who read and comment frequently, a different one to less engaged subscribers, and another to your new subscribers).

Substack’s straightforward monetization stands out from the other blogging options. If you decide it’s time to profit from your blog, you can set the price and let the platform’s built-in functionality manage the logistics (Substack keeps $1 0 \%$ , you get $9 0 \%$ ). Once you start requesting payment, the pressure is on, though. Your paying subscribers will expect brilliant new articles to be delivered at regular intervals.

The platform also offers a reasonable level of flexibility; for example, you can

Customize the layout   
Use custom domains   
¡ Publish a mix of free and paid content   
¡ Offer free trials and discounts   
Integrate with Google Analytics   
¡ Block AI training on your content   
Hand-pick what other publications are recommended to your subscribers

It does not, however, enable you to set another site as the canonical URL (discussed in chapter 15). If you opt to use Substack, you should treat it as your primary blogging platform.

The main downside of using Substack compared to Medium and friends: you need to bring your own audience or build it from scratch. On Medium, dev.to, and Hashnode, you tap into an existing audience. Your content can be discovered by users browsing the site, and any article could go viral and reach thousands of new readers. On Substack, discoverability is limited. You won't grow subscribers unless your Substack is promoted through other channels (e.g., social media, virtual communities, or recommendations

from other Substacks). While Medium offers new authors potential for exposure, Substack provides recognized experts a more transparent path to monetization.

What if you prefer the control of having your own site but also want the email notifications of Substack? Some platforms, like Ghost, offer native newsletter functionality. There are also many plugins that can be integrated into WordPress or other frameworks. Some, like Buttondown, support paid subscriptions as well. Alternatively, you can take the super simple path of creating your own digest email as a LinkedIn newsletter.

# Other means of monetization

As mentioned back in chapter 1, engineers tend to write blog posts for the sake of connecting with the community, advancing the state of the art, and developing their domain expertise—not for profit. But if you’re interested in monetization (to cover your hosting costs, at least), know that a few options are available.

In addition to placing a paywall in front of your content, you could also host ads on your blog site, include affiliate links, or even allow your fans to support you directly via Patreon or GitHub sponsorships.

To learn more about monetization options, we recommend the following resources:

¡ Dan Luu’s “Blog Monetization” (https://danluu.com/blog-ads/)   
Discussions in the r/blogging subreddit, as well as the infamous Hacker News comment sections (search for terms like “monetize blog” and “ads blog”)

# A.1.4 HackerNoon, DZone, freeCodeCamp, and similar

You can also directly submit blog posts to publications such as HackerNoon, DZone, free-CodeCamp, ITNext, and similar Medium publications. (Better Programming was previously a good option, but it is currently on hiatus.) Since these publications perform a level of editorial review, expect a delay before publication. There’s also a chance that your post will be rejected for failing to comply with various criteria.

HackerNoon allows people to subscribe to your updates; DZone and freeCodeCamp do not. Articles published in a Medium publication will appear in your personal Medium profile and trigger notifications for your followers.

# A.2 Selective tech publications

In chapter 15, we discussed why and how to get your article published by selective tech publications: media platforms and journals with a high level of editorial curation, selectivity, and control. Authors propose article ideas, and editors determine which ones are actually published (and when). The publication’s staff reviews, proofreads, and posts the article.

Here’s a rundown of tech publications that accept contributed articles:

InfoQ—For practitioners, by practitioners. Their goal is “to share inspiring content from real-world use cases, best practices used by innovator and early adopter companies, and news on emerging trends.” (https://www.infoq.com/ write-for-infoq/)   
¡ The New Stack—Analyzes and explains technology with a focus on building software at scale, covering topics across cloud native computing, frontend and backend software development. Read by technologists, analysts, investors, technical consultants, and pundits. (https://thenewstack.io/contributions/)   
;login: Online—An open-access publication driven by the USENIX community. Their readership includes USENIX members, as well as the broader USENIX conference communities across systems research, SRE, and security and privacy. (https://mng.bz/lrdR)   
¡ CODE Magazine—Born in 2000 with a focus on the Microsoft software development ecosystem, this publication shares in-depth information on how to use various development tools. It targets developers and technical managers. (https:// codemag.com/Write)   
¡ ACM Queue—This is ACM’s magazine for practicing software engineers. It “takes a critical look at current and emerging technologies, highlighting problems that are likely to arise and posing questions that software engineers should be thinking about.” (https://dl.acm.org/magazine/queue, https://mng.bz/DpPg)   
¡ Communications of the ACM—This is ACM’s “platform to present and debate various technology implications, public policies, engineering challenges, and market trends.” It’s read by professionals across the computing and information technology fields. (https://dl.acm.org/magazine/cacm, https://mng.bz/DpPg)   
¡ IEEE Software—This peer-reviewed publication “positions itself between pure research and pure practice, transferring ideas, methods, and experiences among researchers and engineers.” It covers all aspects of software engineering, processes, and practices. (https://mng.bz/NBPx)

# A.3 Book publishers

If and when you’re interested in writing a book (as covered throughout chapter 17), consider the following options.

# A.3.1 Traditional publishers

Here are some of the most popular publishers of tech books:

¡ Apress —Covers “a wide range of technologies, from big data solutions to Microsoft or Apple development to security to Linux administration to electronics and Raspberry Pi.” (https://www.apress.com/gp/write-for-us)

TIP Gregor Hohpe’s article The Economics of Writing Technical Books (https:// mng.bz/EOPD) provides helpful insights and comparisons on self-publishing options.

# A.4 Writing and editing tools

It’s now easier than ever to make your writing clear and correct thanks to the available tools. Experiment and find some that work for your needs and preferences—a tool that’s annoying to one person could be instrumental for another. As with IDEs, preferences vary widely. Whichever you choose, treat it as an advisor, not a rewriter; think critically about all suggestions and don’t let it suppress your authentic voice (as discussed in chapter 5).

Some options to consider:

¡ Grammarly —This has become the standard for catching grammatical mistakes, spelling errors, and misused words. It won’t catch everything, but it’s fast, easy, and free proofreading. The paid version catches more problems and offers revision functionality as well. (https://app.grammarly.com/)

¡ Vale —This open source, customizable tool can be run from the command line or integrated into IDEs like Vim. It can spot spelling errors, repeated words, “weasel words,” passive voice, and wordy sentences. Its GitHub page (https://github .com/errata-ai/vale) shows how it compares to other open source options such as Proselint, Textlint, Alex, and RedPen. (https://vale.sh/)   
LanguageTool —A spelling, style, and grammar checker that helps correct or paraphrase text. Its core functionality is open source. You can configure your own language usage rules as well as set up your own LanguageTool server locally or in the cloud. (https://languagetool.org/dev)   
Hemingway —Analyzes your text and highlights (literally—see figure A.1) sentences that could be made more concise and easier to read. It notes overly complex sentences, use of passive voice, overuse of adverbs, and other things that the writer Hemingway allegedly hated. The paid version will attempt to rewrite it for you. Note that many writers feel that Hemingway’s recommendations lead to bland writing, so proceed with caution. (https://hemingwayapp.com/)

TIP If you want help finding that perfect word, two thesaurus options are WordHippo (https://www.wordhippo.com/) and Power Thesaurus (https:// www.powerthesaurus.org/). Or, try generative AI.

# A.5 Visualization tools

Not an artist? No problem. Tools can help, whether you want something sharp or scribbly style images that seem hand-drawn:

¡ Draw.io —Perfect for systems diagrams (https://www.drawio.com/)   
Excalidraw—For a hand-drawn look and feel (https://excalidraw.com/)   
¡ Figma—Helps you create professional-looking images (https://www.figma .com/)   
¡ Lucidchart —Also helps you create professional-looking images (https://www .lucidchart.com/)   
¡ Miro —Another tool that helps you create professional-looking images (https:// miro.com/)

# A.6 Code display tools

Some practical and interesting options for embedding code within your blog:

¡ Asciicinema —Records and shares terminal sessions (https://asciinema.org/)   
Codapi —Embeds executable code snippets directly into your blog post (https:// antonz.org/code-examples)   
¡ Gist —Shares code, notes, and snippets via GitHub (https://gist.github.com/)
